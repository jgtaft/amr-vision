							<h2>Why Antimicrobial Resistance?</h2>
							<p></span>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat. Researchers and medical professionals have been struggling to gather and centralize data on antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and only recently have more comprehensive databases for tracking of AMR infections and genes emerged. </p>
							<h2>What is ARDVARC?</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/megaplate.png" alt></span><p>ARDVARC builds on the ease of culturing and sequencing bacteria that have evolved in lab settings to produce AMR-related mutations. By comparing a wild-type genome against a large set of possible past or future mutations, we can point to places where future mutations might occur for this genome. This makes it easier to find AMR-related patterns in the genome. Given continuously falling genome sequencing prices and the subsequent rise in accessibility of whole-genome sequencing, we aim to consolidate the computational work involved in processing the sequenced genomes. With ARDVARC, researchers can conveniently perform almost all the bioinformatics analysis they need in one easy step.</p>
							<br/>

							<h2>Who is ARDVARC for?</h2>
							<p>Researchers in hospitals and universities will find ARDVARC useful as they collect samples of wild-type bacteria and seek to understand what AMR-related mutations might occur next.</p>

							<h2>Who is THE RESISTANCE?</h2>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/team.jpg" alt></span><p>We are a diverse group of biologists, engineers, and computer scientists all with the shared goal of improving the treatment of the antibiotic resistance crisis. <strong>Rachel Diao, Cassidy Mileti</strong>, and <strong>Martin St√ºbler</strong> make up the the biological sciences division, responsible for understanding the problems and needs of researchers in the field. <strong>Julian Eng</strong> and <strong>Suzie Petryk</strong> are data scientists who created the neural network behind ARDVARC. <strong>Jessie Taft</strong> is responsible for the the visualization of the data and website design. </p>

							<h2>How did you make this project?</h2>
							<h3>Genome Classification</h3>
							<p>The genome classifier was written in Python. It uses a random forest to learn genes on a never-before-seen genome that align with existing mutations associated with AMR.</p>
							<h3>Visualization & Web</h3>
							<p>The visualization tool was adapted from work by <a href="https://github.com/lairdm/islandplot">Matthew Laird</a>.</p>
							<h3>Sponsorship & Support</h3>
							<p>ARDVARC was created for the 2018 Health Hackathon, sponsored by Cornell University, GlaxoSmithKline, and Johnson & Johnson. The team thanks all the sponsors for their support, and the Hackathon mentors for their ideas and encouragement.</p>
