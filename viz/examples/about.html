							<h2>Why Antimicrobial Resistance?</h2>
							<p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a growing threat. Researchers and medical professionals have been struggling to gather and centralize data on antibiotic-resistant pathogens, and only recently have more comprehensive databases for tracking of AMR infections and genes emerged. </p>
							<h2>What is ARDVARC?</h2>
							<p>ARDVARC improves on the tools used by researchers to improve the study of bacterial genomes. Our primary goal is to improve the ease of finding patterns in the genome, particularly patterns in the evolution of antibiotic resistance. Given the continuously falling genome sequencing prices and the subsequent rise in accessibility of whole-genome sequencing, we aim to consolidate the computational work involved in processing the sequenced genomes. With ARDVARC, researchers can conveniently perform almost all the bioinformatics analysis they need in one easy step!</p>
							<h2>Who is THE RESISTANCE?</h2>
							<p>We are a diverse group of biologists, engineers, and computer scientists all with the shared goal of improving the treatment of the antibiotic resistance crisis. <strong>Rachel Diao, Cassidy Mileti</strong>, and <strong>Martin St√ºbler</strong> make up the the biological sciences division, responsible for understanding the problems and needs of researchers in the field. <strong>Julian Eng</strong> and <strong>Suzie Petryk</strong> are data scientists who created the neural network behind ARDVARC. <strong>Jessie Taft</strong> is responsible for the the visualization of the data and website design. </p>
							<h2>How did you make this project?</h2>
							<h3>Genome Classification</h3>
							<p>The genome classifier was written in Python. It uses a random forest to learn genes on a never-before-seen genome that align with existing mutations associated with AMR.</p>
							<h3>Visualization & Web</h3>
							<p>The visualization tool was adapted from work by <a href="https://github.com/lairdm/islandplot">Matthew Laird</a>.</p>
